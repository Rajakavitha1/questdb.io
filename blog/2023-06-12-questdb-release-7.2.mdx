## QeustDB 7.2 release overview

In QuestDB 7.2, we introduce implicit variable-size
[time partitions](/docs/concept/partitions/).

The new feature intelligently splits partitions at strategic points, ensuring
smaller partition sizes and reducing the surface area for copy-on-write
operations. This minimizes write amplification and maintains high write
performance, even during heavy load scenarios.

Previously, QuestDB utilized fixed-size time partitions to store data in
[ascending chronological order](/docs/concept/storage-model/). However, this
approach resulted in write amplification, particularly towards the end of each
time interval.

To tackle this problem, implicit variable-size time partitions are introduced.

With the new feature, write amplification is reduced by orders of magnitude.
Users can now experience sustained write performance, even in demanding
environments.

To further optimize the system, we have implemented a sophisticated statistical
model to balance the split and squash logic. As a result, partitions
statistically unlikely to be modified again are asynchronously squashed,
reducing the number of files on disk and alleviating stress on the OS metadata
catalog.

## Breaking changes for QuestDB 7.2

This is a breaking change. Partitions created by 7.2 may not be understood by
earlier versions.

To downgrade the instance version, you may need to
[`SQUASH`](/docs/reference/sql/alter-table-squash-partitions/) partitions for
each table.
