Application use cases have expanded and accelerated, and developers have outgrown the capabilities of conventional relational databases. As a result, new databases have emerged with solutions to urgent and emerging requirements. Among them, no requirement has grown more than the need to handle explosive volumes of **time-series data**:

Today, InfluxDB, TimescaleDB and QuestDB offer the cutting edge of time-series database solutions. But what is at the root of the sudden interest in time-series databases? And how do these compelling offerings compare?

### Why use a time-series database?

[Time-series databases (TSDB)](/glossary/time-series-database/) are databases
optimized to ingest, process, and store timestamped data. Such data may include
metrics from servers and applications, readings from IoT sensors, user
interactions on a website or an app, or trading activity on financial markets.

The following properties often characterize time-series workloads:

- Each data point includes a timestamp which is used to index, aggregate, and sample. The
  data can also be multi-dimensional and correlated.
- High write speed (ingestion) is preferred to better capture data at high frequencies.
- Summarized views of the data (e.g., downsampled or aggregated view, trend
  lines) may provide more insight than a single data point. For example, given
  network unreliability or outliers in sensor readings, we may set alerts when
  an average value over time exceeds a threshold.
- Analyzing the data usually requires accessing it over some window of time
  (e.g., give me the click rate data over the past week).

While conventional databases can also handle time-series data to a certain extent,
TSDBs are designed with the above properties to handle data ingestion, storage,
and aggregation over time more efficiently. So as the demand for time-series
data continues to explode on the heels of cloud computing, IoT, financial market
data, and machine learning, how should architects go about choosing a
time-series database? Which offers the most promise?

## InfluxDB

Released in 2013, InfluxDB is the market leader in the TSDB space,
supplanting Graphite and OpenTSDB which came before it. As with many OSS database companies, InfluxDB is licensed with the MIT License for a single node, with paid-plans available for InfluxDB Cloud and InfluxDB enterprise that provide clustering and other production-ready features.

Previously, the InfluxDB Platform consisted of the TICK stack: Telegraf (agent for collecting and reporting metrics), InfluxDB (the database engine), Chronograf (web interface to InfluxDB), and Kapacitor (background processing).

Since version 2.x, InfluxDB is now installed as a single binary that bundles the database, the UI, and the background processor. If you want to use Telegraf, it is still supported as a separate binary.

:::note

This article was updated in March 2023 from its 2021 publish date to acknowledge that InfluxDB now offers additional versions with updated query engines and capabilities. The following refers to Open Source InfluxDB 2.6.

:::

To understand how InfluxDB works, we need to grasp the following key concepts:

- **Data model (tagset model)**: Besides the timestamp field, each data element
  consists of various tags (optional, indexed metadata fields), fields (key and
  value), and measurements (container for tags, fields, and timestamps). The
  example below takes census data from bees and ants, collected in Klamath and
  Portland by scientists Anderson and Mullen. Here `location` and `scientist` are
  tags, falling under the census measurement with field/value pair for `bees` and
  `ants`.

  width={770}
  title="Image Credit: Influxdata"
/>

- **Schemaless Design:** InfluxDB does not enforce a schema before ingesting data. Instead, the schema is inferred automatically from the tags and fields sent over the line protocol. This grants more flexibility when writing applications. In any case, it is possible to enforce schemas for specific buckets if needed.

- **Data storage (TSM & TSI):** data points are stored in time-structured merge tree (TSM) and time series index (TSI) files. TSM can be thought of as an LSM tree with a write-ahead log (WAL) and read-only files, similar to SSTables that are sorted and compressed. 

  The caveat within this model is that [high cardinality data](/glossary/high-cardinality/) has decreased performance. As evidence, in InfluxDB OSS 2.6, the [schema design documentation](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.7/write-data/best-practices/schema-design/) offers guidance to prevent high series cardinality.

- **Query languages:** Earlier in its lifecycle, InfluxDB supported only SQL-like query language InfluxQL. In 2018,
  [InfluxDB announced Flux](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/why-were-building-flux-a-new-data-scripting-and-query-language/),
  a domain-specific functional language which was to become
  the new recommended query language. 
  
  InfluxDB's decision to create its own custom functional data scripting language (Flux) presents another layer of complexity to mastering the ecosystem. Implementing Flux requires effort, especially if you're only looking for simple SQL queries or not interested in learning another new language.

Overall, InfluxDB is a solid choice when time-series data fits nicely within a preferred cardinality-limited schema. Thus their main use cases gear towards infrastructure/application monitoring. However, as the market leader in this space, InfluxDB also integrates with popular data sources.

- **Pros:** schemaless ingestion, huge community, integrations with popular tools
- **Cons:** low performance with high-cardinality datasets, multiple versions with differing database engines, supported languages, and features. Need to learn Flux.

## TimescaleDB

Whereas InfluxDB opted to build a new database and custom language from scratch, on the other end of the spectrum is TimescaleDB. It is a time-series focused PostgreSQL extension with cloud-managed and self-managed options. 

PostgreSQL compatibility is both TimescaleDB's biggest selling point and its biggest drawback. It supports SQL features (e.g., joins, secondary and partial indexes) as well as popular extensions like [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/). But while it improves upon the performance of standard PostreSQL for time-series use cases, its claims are relative to that of PostgreSQL's native performance and not a purpose built time-series database.

TimescaleDB is built upon the traditional row-based architecture of PostgreSQL, as opposed to the modernized column-based architecture seen in DuckDB, InfluxDB Cloud and QuestDB. Row-based architecture performs well within Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) where use cases see a large number of transactional inserts, updates and deletes by many users. By comparison, columnar models excel within Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) cases, which require much higher ingestion speeds and more complex queries, exemplified by the analysis of market or systems data. 

TimescaleDB has improved upon the OLTP foundation of PostreSQL with the following features:

- **Hypertables:** Hypertables sit alongside standard PostgreSQL tables to better handle time-series data. They require data to be partitioned into configurable chunks based on a time column. Chunks need to be tuned for optimal performance.

- **Continuous Aggregation:** TimescaleDB also supports continuous aggregation of data to make computing key metrics like hourly average, minimum, and maximum values fast. Behind the scenes, the data is stored using PostgreSQL [materialized views](/glossary/materialized-view/); additional storage is needed as a trade-off for faster queries. 

- **Data Retention:** Large deletes are a costly operation in traditional [relational databases](/glossary/relational-database/). However, since TimescaleDB stores data in chunks, it provides a `drop_chunks` feature to quickly drop old data without the same overhead. Since the relevance of old data diminishes over time, TimescaleDB can be used to move older data to save disk space.

Overall, TimescaleDB is a good fit for teams looking for a performance boost over PostgreSQL for time-series data without heavy refactoring to migrate off their existing SQL databases. Even though TimescaleDB is still relatively new (first released in 2017), the decision to build on top of PostgreSQL has boosted its adoption numbers to reach the top 5 TSDBs.

However, besides performance, another drawback is the lack of a streaming ingestion protocol like the InfluxDB Line Protocol. This makes ingestion less flexible and less focused on performance as a result.

- **Pros:** PostgreSQL-compatibility, scales better than InfluxDB with data cardinality, various
  deployment models available.
- **Cons:** enforced schema that requires configuration, ingest rate capabilities limited by PostgreSQL, extra storage needed for continuous aggregations, lack of streaming ingestion protocol. Parts of the code licensed under a proprietary License ("TSL").

## QuestDB

QuestDB is an open-source TSDB written in low-latency Java, C++, and Rust. It is the fastest growing database within [DB-Engine's Time Series DBMS](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking/time+series+dbms) rankings. Alongside the Apache 2.0 licensed open-source project, it also offers a fully managed [Cloud offering](https://questdb.io/cloud/) and [a commercial Enterprise version](https://questdb.io/enterprise/). For those looking to take advantage of the flexibility of the InfluxDB line protocol and the familiarity of PostgreSQL, QuestDB may satisfy both requirements without sacrificing performance. 

At the heart of QuestDB is a highly optimized [column-based storage model](https://questdb.io/glossary/columnar-database/). Data are sorted by time natively and stored in time partitions, which are append-only and versioned. QuestDB only lifts the latest version of the partition in memory for any given time-based query. As such, queries do not slow down as more data is being ingested.

By building the database engine from scratch, the QuestDB team focused on three things:

- **Performance:** Solving the ingestion bottleneck with high throughput
  ingestion, for datasets of all sizes. QuestDB addresses one of the pain points
  of InfluxDB, with its ability to handle high cardinality datasets. To speed up
  queries, QuestDB leverages modern hardware with SIMD instructions, aggregating
  multiple rows simultaneously. The engineering team built
  [a JIT compiler](/docs/concept/jit-compiler/) designed to parallelize query
  filters during execution. QuestDB stores data in time partitions; this reduces
  the volume of data which has to fit in memory for reads. Finally, the database
  is column based and can handle a high degree of parallelism, slicing and
  processing columns in parallel by all available threads.

- **Compatibility:** QuestDB supports InfluxDB line protocol, PostgreSQL wire,
  REST API and CSV upload to ingest data. Users accustomed to other time-series
  databases can easily port over their existing applications without a
  significant rewrite, and users can choose amongst a set of ingestion protocols
  depending on their use cases. There are client libraries in multiple languages
  for the InfluxDB Line Protocol.

- **Querying via SQL:** Despite supporting multiple ingestion mechanisms,
  QuestDB uses SQL as the query language, so there's no need to learn a
  domain-specific language like Flux. Additionally, there are
  time-series-specific
  [SQL extensions](https://questdb.io/blog/2022/11/23/sql-extensions-time-series-data-questdb-part-ii/)
  to handle time-series data with ease.

In terms of performance, QuestDB
[recently posted some benchmark results](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/releases/tag/7.0.1)
with an ingestion rate reaching 4.3 million rows per second. This was computed
through the [TSBS benchmark](https://github.com/timescale/tsbs), currently
maintained by TimescaleDB, selecting the `cpu-only` use case. The chosen
instance had 32 CPUs and 64GB of RAM, with a fast SSD disk (NVMe). Fast disks
allow to better cope with writes that are I/O bound - in this case when a lot of
out of order data is being ingested concurrently. For most use cases, slower
disks such as AWS EBS volumes are enough to extract sufficient performance.

/>

The other interesting component of QuestDB is support for both InfluxDB Line
Protocol and PostgreSQL wire for ingestion. For existing InfluxDB users, you can
configure Telegraf to point to QuestDB's address and port. PostgreSQL users can
leverage their client libraries or JDBC to write data into QuestDB. Regardless
of the ingestion method, data can be queried using standard SQL with notable
exceptions listed on the API reference page.

When it comes to third party integrations, QuestDB integrates with some of the most popular tools (e.g., PostgreSQL, Grafana, Pandas, Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, MindsDB, Telegraf, Kubernetes...). There are more integrations underway, such as more dashboards / BI tools.

One drawback of QuestDB (at the time of writing) is its lack of window functions and materialized views. QuestDB is the newest time-series database and still lacks a degree of expressiveness for queries. Both items are on the team's [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/questdb/projects/1/views/5).

- **Pros:** fast ingestion, better performance using fewer resources, support
  for both InfluxDB protocol and PostgreSQL wire, querying via standard SQL,
  optimized queries with SIMD, open source and fully managed QuestDB versions
  available.
- **Cons:** smaller community, reduced number of available integrations, lack of window functions at time of writing.

## Conclusion

As the demand for time-series data continues to grow, time-series specialized databases will see massive adoption and fierce
competition. Besides the three open-source TSDBs covered in this article, there are also public cloud offerings from AWS (AWS Timestream) and Azure (Azure Series Insights).

As with all databases, choosing the "perfect" time-series database depends primarily on your business requirements, data
model, and use case. InfluxDB works well if your data fits the Tagset model with a rich ecosystem of integrations
readily available. However, performance degrades with high cardinality data, and Flux is a new language to be learned. TimescaleDB is a natural fit for existing PostgreSQL users, but it is a row-oriented database, thus less optimized for time-series and analytical workloads.  Finally, if performance is the primary concern, QuestDB is a
popular and developer-friendly database growing rapidly, although less mature than InfluxDB and TimescaleDB.
